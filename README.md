# Data_engineering_2
This is the GitHub page for the second assignment of the Data Engineering course (Master of Data Science in Business and Entrepreneurship).
The code includes a lambda resembling data architecture with a batch processing and stream processing pipeline.
Here the stream processing is handled through an Apache Kafka producer and the data pipelines are run on an Apache Spark cluster.
The data for the project is too big to put into the github (as no files over 25MB are allowed and the data was bigger than that). Thus it cannot be put into the github.
The link to the data is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrezaza/clapper-massive-rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-reviews?select=rotten_tomatoes_movie_reviews.csv
